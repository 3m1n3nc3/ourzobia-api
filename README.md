Ourzobia PHP Api is an open source php product validation platform, that will help you protect your PHP codes from unauthorized use.
This is perfect for you if you have PHP scripts distributed via online marketplaces, and would require that customers who purchase 
your script enter an activation code, before they are able to use the product.

#### Advantages of using Ourzobia PHP API
  1. Written on the latest version of Codeigniter framework.
  2. Activation code is only valid for a single domain.
  3. Uses cookies to prevent frequent calls to validation server.
  4. Can be hosted on Github and served via CDN.
  5. Validation is done outside the validating script, making it rather difficult to break.
